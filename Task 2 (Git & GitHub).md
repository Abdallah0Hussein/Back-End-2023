Generally, Version Control Systems are software tools that help teams manage and track changes to files and directories over time for every contributor. It also provides a historical record of all changes made to a project, including who made the changes and when. If a developer makes a mistake in the code the tool offers you to turn back to the earlier version or compare them to fix the mistake done instead of taking a backup of the source code every time. You can use It to prevent the current work from conflicting without blocking the work of the rest of the team by using branching and merging as you can create branches for new features, or bug fixes without affecting the main branch (default branch which is the stable version of the project) then merge those changes back into the main branch when they are ready.
Let’s talk about Git and GitHub. Git is the version control system, a command-line tool that operates locally on your machine. It's used for tracking changes to files and directories, allowing teams to collaborate efficiently. Git depends on copying the repository onto your local machine then you can “push” to the remote repository. On the other hand, GitHub is a platform built around Git, primarily used for hosting and sharing Git repositories, collaborating with teams, managing projects, and contributing to open-source software. GitHub offers both web-based interfaces and desktop applications.

  To add git to the project:
	First: type git init
	Second: git add . (to add all files)
	Third: git commit -m "Your commit"
	Fourth: git push
